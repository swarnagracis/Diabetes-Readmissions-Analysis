**Diabetes Readmission Analysis Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a diabetic hospital encounters dataset using Power BI.

The objective was to explore:

-30-Day hospital readmissions

-Clinical risk factors

-Operational utilization patterns

-Resource consumption trends

-Admission & discharge performance

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard structured into three analytical layers:

1.Executive Overview

2.Clinical Insights & Risk Factors

3.Utilization & Operational Efficiency

**Dataset Summary**

-Total Encounters: ~99,000

-Average Length of Stay: 4.38 days 

-Average Medications per Encounter: 15.98 

-Overall Readmission Rate: 47% 

-30-Day Readmission Rate (Primary Diabetes): 13% 

The dataset includes:

-Demographics (Age, Gender, Race)

-Diagnoses (Primary & Secondary)

-Admission and discharge types

-Medication data

-Visit history (Inpatient, Outpatient, Emergency)

-Laboratory utilization

-Readmission flags

**📈 Dashboard Structure**

**1. Executive Overview**

This page provides high-level KPIs and demographic distributions.

Key Metrics

Total Encounters

Readmission Rate

30-Day Readmission Rate

Average Length of Stay

Average Medications

Demographic Insights

Race distribution (Majority Caucasian ~77.9%) 

Gender distribution (~53.56% Female) 

Readmission rate across age groups

**Key Insight:**

Older age groups (60–80+) show increased readmission intensity compared to younger cohorts.

**2. Clinical Insights & Risk Factors**

This section analyzes disease severity, medication patterns, and diagnostic impact.

Top Primary Diagnoses by volume:

Circulatory

Respiratory

Digestive

Diabetes 

Other

*Circulatory conditions dominate encounter volume.*

**Medication Utilization**

Medication count correlates with utilization intensity

Higher medication load is associated with increased readmission risk

**Laboratory Utilization**

Lab procedures are highest among:

Circulatory conditions (~1.29M procedures), Indicating higher clinical complexity.

**Readmission Risk Heatmap**

Diagnosis × Age matrix shows:

Highest 30-day readmission risk in 20–30 age band under Diabetes category (~20%) 

**3. Utilization & Operational Efficiency**

This section evaluates hospital workload and service pressure.

**Visit Type Distribution**

Inpatient visits: 63K

Outpatient visits: 37K

Emergency visits: 20K 

*Inpatient services dominate hospital utilization.*

**Length of Stay by Admission Type**

Certain admission types show disproportionately high cumulative hospital days, indicating operational bottlenecks. 

**Readmissions by Admission Source**

Some admission sources show significantly elevated 30-day readmission rates (up to 56%). 

**Readmissions by Discharge Disposition**

Specific discharge categories show higher readmission probability (up to 47%). 

*This suggests potential discharge planning inefficiencies.*

**🎯 Key Findings**

1. Circulatory and respiratory diagnoses drive the highest utilization.

2. Readmission burden is concentrated in specific age groups.

3. Higher medication counts and lab utilization correlate with severity.

4. Discharge disposition strongly influences 30-day readmission.

5.Inpatient utilization significantly outweighs outpatient follow-up.
